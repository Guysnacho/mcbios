				The Abstract should not exceed 300 words. Please minimize the use of
				abbreviations and do not cite references in the abstract.&nbsp;
			  </p>
			  <p>The abstract must include the following separate sections:</p>

			  <li>Results: the main findings</li>
			  <li>Conclusions: a brief summary and potential implications</li>
			  <p><br /></p>
			  <p>
				There are a limited number of spots for oral presentations. If not

				for poster presentation. Oral presentations will be 10-15 min long
				including questions, depending on the session program designed by
				the session chair. Poster size limitation: 30″W x 20″H (91cm x

				proceedings in Frontiers in Artificial Intelligence. The deadline
				for full paper submission is May 1, 2023.

			  <h3>Student Travel Stipends</h3>
			  <p>
				Limited number of student/trainee travel stipends (including a
				registration fee waiver and/or lodging support) are available to
				those who apply and register by January 27, 2023. Students/trainees
				who are submitting an abstract for oral or poster presentation are
				invited to apply for a stipend to help defray the cost of attending
				the conference.
			  </p>
			  <p>
				Stipends will be offered on a first-come-first-served basis and
				priority will be given to those selected for platform
				presentations.&nbsp;Students without institutional support will
				receive higher priority for these funds. Expenses that are not
				supported by travel stipend will be the responsibility of the
				attendee.
			  </p>
			  <p>
				As we work with sponsors, additional awards may become available to
				paid registrants to present high-quality work, which is determined
				by the MCBIOS ’23 Fellowship and Award Committee.
			  </p>
			  <p>
