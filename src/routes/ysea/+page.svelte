							There are two categories of the awards: graduate students and postdoctoral fellows. If
							you are a graduate student or a postdoc, we invite you to apply. If you are a mentor
							of trainees, please encourage your trainees to apply. Three individuals will be
							selected as finalists in each category. Those selected will give an oral presentation
							at the conference where they will be judged by the Awards Committee. All finalists
							have an opportunity to compete for a cash prize of
							<b>$500 (1st place), $300 (2nd place) or $100 (3rd place)</b>
							awarded in each category based on their presentations. Applicants who are not selected
							as YSEA finalists will automatically be considered for a regular oral presentation at the
							conference or can present a poster.

					<h2><b>Judging Criteria</b></h2>
					<ul class="list-circle" style="font-size: 18px">
						<li>
							While the quality and impact of the research will be a consideration, the quality of
							your professional presentation will be by far the primary consideration for the award
							(the judges will understand that the research topic is usually determined by the
							institution and advisor and is not wholly within your control).
						</li>
						<li>
							Research that is neither too stale (i.e., old and recycled), nor too immature is
							preferred.
						</li>
						<li>
							The creativity, dedication and multidisciplinary contributions you have demonstrated
							in carrying out the research will be important factors.
						</li>
						<li>
							The multidisciplinary talent and initiative you have demonstrated to expand your
							skills will be an important consideration.
						</li>
						<li>
							Whether you have shown an understanding of the scientific method will be an important
							factor (e.g., validity and reliability considerations).
						</li>
						<li>
							CLARITY will be critical, in both the submitted application as well as in the
							presentation.
						</li>
					</ul>

					<h2><b>Award Application</b></h2>
