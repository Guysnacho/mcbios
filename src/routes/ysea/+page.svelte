					<h3>"MCBIOS Young Scientist Excellence"</h3>
					<p>
						Applications must be submitted by January 10th, 2023. &nbsp;Applications from students
						and postdoctoral fellows will be rigorously evaluated. The top four candidates will be
						invited to give an oral presentation in a session dedicated to this award program. In
						addition to an abstract, participation in this program requires submission of a separate
						description of the innovation of the research
						<strong>(150 words or less)</strong> and the individualâ€™s contribution to the work being
						presented <strong>(150 words or less)</strong>. Selection of the top four candidates is
						based on the evaluation of the applications by the MCBIOS board members for quality and
						impact of the research. The finalists are selected by a panel of judges (including
						keynote speakers) after the oral presentations. The quality of the professional
						presentation is the primary consideration for selection of the award recipients.
						Applicants with demonstrated multidisciplinary contribution and initiative are given
						preference during final selection. Announcement of the awards will be made during the
						final luncheon.&nbsp;
