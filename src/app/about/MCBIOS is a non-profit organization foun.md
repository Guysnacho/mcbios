MCBIOS is a non-profit organization found in 2003, started as a grassroots effort spearheaded by a small group of researchers at FDA NCTR (located in Little Rock, Arkansas). It has since been expanded significantly. It is now one of only two regional societies in North America (with GLBIO) affiliated with ISCB, the biggest international bioinformatics society.

The mission of MCBIOS is to foster networking and collaboration and to promote the professional development of members and supporting our student members. The annual conference is the flagship event for MCBIOS, which attract talented scientists from across the nation who gather together for the sharing of scientific information to advance our understanding in nature and health. The annual conferences have enjoyed a long history.

The 2024 version will be the 20th of the series. For MCBIOS 2024, we have already secured four plenary speakers and more than 80 world-class researchers to present in more than 20 invited technical sessions and workshops. Additionally, there will be Young Scientist Excellence Award (YSEA) sessions, poster sessions, hackathon and many more fun activities.

All registered attendees are eligible to submit their research papers to MCBIOS 2024 proceedings to be published as special issues of high-quality Bioinformatics journals. We are looking forward to a great Bioinformatics conference with lasting impact. Please join us!
