          <p>
            One Director may propose the removal of another Director with a
            strong justification such as their improper behavior during their
            term, gross negligence, or failure to properly fulfill the duties of
            a Director. In such a situation, the President (but if the President
            is accused, the responsibility should be taken by the Past
            President) needs to investigate and present the evidence in written
            form to the rest of the Board of Directors (excluding the accused
            and accuser) to solicit an anonymous vote of removal. The number of
            votes must meet or exceed the quorum (calculated based on the
            remaining number of Board of Directors) to proceed with the removal.
            If the support for removal exceeds a minimum of 70% of the votes,
            the announcement of the removal will also be posted on the
            organization website with the verbiage approved by the Board of
            Directors. The Board of Directors shall name an acting replacement
            Director to serve the remainder of the current term year until the
            next Annual Meeting at which time the Members shall elect a
            replacement to serve out the remaining term, if any, of that

            a new President-Elect (as usual) at the next Annual Meeting. If the
            resigning/removed Director held the office of President, then the
            President-Elect will immediately become President for the remainder
            of the current term year and will remain as President for the
            subsequent term year, as originally planned, with the Members
