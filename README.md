Welcome to the home of the 2024 MCBIOS Conference.

Everything you need to build a Svelte project, powered by [`create-svelte`](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/tree/master/packages/create-svelte).

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install`, start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open

```

## Building

To create a production version of the app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> Currently I'm building with the static site generator [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) to make deployment to the PHP server easy.
