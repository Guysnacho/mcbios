Welcome to the home of the 2025 MCBIOS Conference.

Everything you need to build a Next.js project, powered by `create-next-app@latest`.


## Developing

Once you've cloned the project run `yarn install` to install dependencies, then run `yarn dev` to start a development server:

## Building

To create a production version of the app:

```bash
yarn build
```

Performing a production build will help you fix linting problems that will pop up in the deployment pipeline.

You can preview the production build with `yarn start`.
